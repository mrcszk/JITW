        This picture was taken in one of the most amazing places in the world (in my opinion) - it is the Monk's Mound near St.Louis, MO. 
       My name seems to mean: 
      IGOR (m.) - Scandinavian 'bow warrior'; quinga, cú "bow", ohtar, mehtar "warrior", so Quingohtar or Quingamehtar or Cúmehtar, 
	  according to http://www.elvish.org/elm/names/i.html
      Actually it supposed it be IVOR, but I guess it was changed to IGOR somewhere about Russia.

      Neuromancer by W.Gibson 
      
Tractate 31: We hypostatize information into objects. Rearrangement of objects is change in the content of the information; the message has changed. This is a language which we have lost the ability to read. We ourselves are a part of this language; changes in us are changes in the content of the information. We ourselves are information-rich; information enters us, is processed and is then projected outward once more, now in an altered form. We are not aware that we are doing this, that in fact this is all we are doing.
      
      
Tractate 36: In summary; thoughts of the brain are experienced by us as arrangements and rearrangements - change - in a physical universe; but in fact it is really information and information-processing which we substantialize. We do not merely see its thoughts as objects, but rather as the movement, or, more precisely, the placement of objects: how they become linked to one another. But we cannot read the patterns of arrangement; we cannot extract the information in it - i.e. it as information, which is what it is. The linking and relinking of objects by the Brain is actually a language but not a language like ours (since it is addressing itself and not someone or something outside itself).
